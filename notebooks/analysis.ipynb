    "After cleaning the text in the Twitter dataset, we have performed an exploratory data analysis on it. By calculating the term frequency and Tf-Idf throughout these Twitter posts, the tables of frequencies were acquired respectively. We noticed that these two vectorizers gave out similar results; for example, the three most frequent terms in both tables are “covid19”, “coronavirus”, and “trump”. In order to visually compare the results, a graph of the word cloud for both vectorizers was generated as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below."

    "To compare the daily term frequencies and the counts of daily covid-19 cases, we tried to visualize the difference between trends by drawing the frequencies of specific terms by dates overlaid the plot of Covid-19 case numbers. After intuitively preselecting the words “great” and “sick” (two words that represent positive and negative sentiment), two graphs are generated by plotting the normalized counts of terms per day and daily case numbers from March 22 to November 30. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, we observed that there are no direct or obvious correlations between the trend of selected terms and the count of daily new cases. "
